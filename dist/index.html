      <h1 id="tribute-info">Summarized history of Botch by years</h1>
      <ul id="list-of-years">
        <li class="list"><span class="year">1993</span> - Bassist Brian Cook, guitarist Dave Knudson, drummer Tim Latona and vocalist Dave Verellen formed Botch while they were all still in high school.</li>
        <li class="list"><span class="year">1995</span> - Botch released "Faction", a 7-inch EP also that same year, Botch went on their first tour outside of the Seattle-area. Dave Verellen's dad drove the group on a mini-tour through Canada in an old van he owned.</li>
        <li class="list"><span class="year">1996</span> - The band released another EP, titled "The John Birch Conspiracy Theory"</li>
        <li class="list"><span class="year">1997</span> - Botch went on a seven-week tour throughout the United States and Canada with Ink & Dagger and Nineironspitfire, which gained them a significant amount of exposure. They also  released "The Unifying Themes of Sex, Death and Religion"—a nine-track compilation album through Excursion Records composed of the EPs The John Birch Conspiracy Theory and Faction in their entirety, and "Closure" from the various artists compilation I Can't Live Without It.</li>
        <li class="list"><span class="year">1998</span> -  After three days of recording and two days of mixing, the completed songs became their debut studio album "American Nervoso", released through Hydra Head Records. In support of American Nervoso, Botch headlined a North American tour with The Dillinger Escape Plan and Jesuit. Beginning with this tour, John Pettibone was hired as the group's manager, and it also was Botch's first time bringing their own lighting equipment with them</li>
        <li class="list"><span class="year">1999</span> - Their second studio "We Are the Romans" was released in November through Hydra Head Records on both CD and double LP vinyl formats. The title of the album was derived from the lyrics to the album's closing track "Man the Ramparts". According to Verellen: "Brian [Cook] thought it'd make a great title, but I thought it was a totally silly gladiator song. The riff is kinda huge, so I was thinking about chariots and fire and stuff like that. It sounds like I pulled the words out of Conan the Barbarian. But then we started talking about the social decline of Western civilization, and how Americans are the new Romans—it's all slaves and Caesars. So we made it work."</li>
        <li class="list"><span class="year">2000</span> - Botch toured Europe with The Dillinger Escape Plan, and also went on a smaller North American tour later that year.</li>
         <li class="list"><span class="year">2001</span> -  In 2001, Botch performed at Louisville, Kentucky's hardcore festival "Krazy Fest 4" which also featured Coalesce, Converge, Poison the Well and Harkonen among others.</li>
         <li class="list"><span class="year">2002</span> - Botch officially decided to break up the band in February. Tensions between Tim Latona and Dave Knudson that originated from the We Are the Romans sessions and supporting tours built up to the point where members weren't communicating anymore. According to Dave Verellen, "it was the best idea for us just to break up while we were on top of things, rather than torture ourselves and keep chipping away till we hated each other." Botch also struggled to write a third studio album citing pressures to write a follow up to their critically acclaimed We Are the Romans and suffering from "crazy writer's block."</br>
      Before disbanding, Botch recorded a six-song EP titled "An Anthology of Dead Ends"—a small collection of songs Botch had written before breaking up. The EP was recorded in March ,an event which was described by producer Matt Bayles as being "incredibly tense." On the album's content, Verellen said: "Two of the tracks are things we did live that we just wanted to record" and one of the songs was "just a riff we never got a song written for, but it was just such a good riff."</br>
    They did their last show and recorded it as a live concert DVD on June 15, 2002 at The Showbox in Seattle, Washington</li>
